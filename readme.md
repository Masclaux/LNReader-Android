- EULA/BT Copyrights on first time run // Need to prepare a EULA.
- Manual add series tutorial for new users

#### TODO next version only

maybe ill add an option to "remove complete downloads automatically" for those who dont like removing manually...

this mascot (is the icon on the upper left, only shows on newer android versions, like a back button) bug is not checked yet.

### Future ideas
- Advanced Customization options
- Integration with external cloud apps for image/database saving:
   * DropBox
   * Box

   * Google Drive

(This is just an IDEA, and as such, not to worry for now.)
